# UPDATE AUG 6, 2018
All is good with crt.sh again. If you have any issues in the future refer to the Aug 4 update and ensure the domain isn't currently down


# UPDATE AUG 4, 2018
I was wondering why my tool was erroring out so I checked out the https://crt.sh website and realized it was 404'ing with the following showing up when cURL'd . Until further notice this tool is sadly broken as it depends on crt.sh
